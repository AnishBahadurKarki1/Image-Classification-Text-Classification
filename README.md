# Sentiment Analysis of Financial Text Using LSTM, RNN, and Word2Vec

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of **financial text data** such as news headlines and
articles using **machine learning and deep learning techniques**. The goal is to classify financial text 
into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments to support better financial analysis and 
decision-making. The project is developed in **Python** and combines traditional machine learning 
models with advanced deep learning architectures like **RNN** and **LSTM**, along with **Word2Vec 
embeddings** to capture semantic meaning in financial language.
